# Bank-of-England-
About In this project, I supported the Bank of England in analysing sentiment across policy speeches from 2019â€“2022 using text analytics. By applying FinBERT and exploring tone shifts by speaker and event, I translated central bank communication trends into insights that inform economic narrative and policy direction.
